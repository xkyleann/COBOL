## Summary
- **The identification division** identifies the program by giving program name.
- **The Environment Division** includes the Input-Output Section, which identifies the input and output files used by the program.
- **The Data Division** includes the file section and the Working-Storage Section. 
- **The Procedure Division** contains the program logic it is typically.

# The A and B margins of a COBOL program (Figure 1-5)

| Columns | Purpose     | Remarks     |
| --- | --------------- | --------- |
| **1-6**   | Sequence | A sequence number is added to each coding line when the program is compiled. As a result, the programmer does not enter anything in these positions. |
| **7**   | Indicator | If there is asterisk in thos column. the entire line is treated as a comment. |
| **8-11**   | A margin | Some coding elements (division names, section names, procedure names, 77 level numbers, and 01 level numbers) have to start in this margin. |
| **12-72**   | B margin | Coding lines that do not start in the A margin have to start in this margin. |
| **73-80**   | Identification | identify program |

# How to code the Identification Division â€“
## The syntax of the Identification Division
```cobol
        IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
        PROGRAM-ID. program-name.         
```
## An Identification Division with the minimum code
```cobol
        IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
        PROGRAM-ID. CALC1000.         
```
## An Identification Division that contains comments 
```cobol
         IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
        *
         PROGRAM-ID. CALC1000.
        *PROGRAMMER.         MIKE MURACH.
        *COMPLETION-DATE.    MARCH 28, 2024.
        *REMARKS.            THIS IS A SIMPLE PROGRAM CALCULATES THE SALES TAX ON AN AMOUNT THAT HAS BEEN ENTERED BY THE USER.   
```

# Working Storage Section of the Data Division  (Figure 1-7 )
- **Creating data names** : Max 30 characters in each name 
- **Example** : SALES-AMOUNT and SALES-TAX are better than A1 and B2.
```cobol
         WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
        *
         77        END-OFF-SESSION-SWITCH         PIC X        VALUE"N".
         77        SALES-AMOUNT                   PIC 9(5)v99.       
         77        SALES-TAX                      PIC Z,ZZZ.99.


```
- **77**: Level number 77 in the Margin A -> data name -> Picture (PIC) clause -> Value Clause in the B margin.
  
### Rules
- Use letters, the digits 0 through 9, and hyphens only.
- Max 30 characters.
- Use at least one letter in the name.
